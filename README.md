## Projects:
* [NASA’s International Space Apps Challenge](https://github.com/heber-augusto/planetaagua/blob/master/data/InterfaceDadosNASA.ipynb):  Using NASA data and using Facebook's Prophet prediction library, found prediction values for level and temperature rise over the next 5 centuries. This prediction was developed in python using the free Google Colab tool;
* [Music generation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)](https://github.com/heber-augusto/aws-deepcomposer-samples): This is a colab runnable version for AWS DeepComposer workshop. The notebook and files which were modified are inside Lab 2 folder. This modified version uses a google drive and copy all repository files into it using git clone command;
* [Azure Machine Learning Foundations Course](https://github.com/heber-augusto/udacity-azure-ml-foudations): Notebooks created during Udacity Azure Machine Learning Foudations course (good to compare the work with and without Azure M.L. Studio);
* [Introduction to Machine Learning from Udacity](https://github.com/heber-augusto/udacity-intro-to-ml): A python3 and docker version with projects developed from Introdution to Machine Learning Course from Udacity;
* [Some useful codes used in my data science projects](https://github.com/heber-augusto/datascience-colab-templates): Some colab notebooks containing templates of code to help with datascience projects.
